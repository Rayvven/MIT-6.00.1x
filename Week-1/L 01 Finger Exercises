(5/5 points)
ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE: 3 minutes
Note that you will have to answer all questions before you can click the Check button.

For each of the following expressions, indicate the type of the expression. While you could simply type these expressions
into your shell, we encourage you to answer them directly since this will help reinforce your understanding of basic
Python expressions.

Note: The Python 'None' keyword

Exercise 6

(10/10 points)
ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE: 5 minutes
Note that you will have to answer all questions before you can click the Check button.

For each of the following expressions, indicate the value returned, or if the evaluation would lead to an error,
write the word 'error' (note this is a word, not a string, no quotes). While you could simply type these expressions
into an IDE, we encourage you to answer them directly since this will help reinforce your understanding of basic
Python expressions.

For decimal answers, give the full result, or at least four decimal places of accuracy (whichever is shortest).

Floating point errors: Decimal numbers cannot be stored exactly in the computer because the computer does not have
an infiite amount of memory. So decimal numbers are rounded when stored. When you do calculations with these numbers,
your final result will be different than the actual result. For exmaple, you may get something like 5.0000000044 instead
of 5.0. This is called floating-point rounding error.

Exercise 7

(6/6 points)
ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE: 3 minutes
Note that you will have to answer all questions before you can click the Check button.

Below is a transcript of a session with the Python shell. For each expression being evaluated, provide the type
and the value the expression returns. If evaluating an expression would cause an error, select 'NoneType' and write
the word 'error' (note this is a word, not a string, no quotes) in the box. While you could simply type these expressions
into your IDE, we encourage you to answer them directly since this will help reinforce your understanding of basic 
Python expressions.

Assume that the expressions are evaluated in the order shown - that is, each problem part is evaluated directly after the
previous problem part(s).

>>> a = 3
>>> a + 2.0 
float - This answer is correct
5.0 - This answer is correct
 
>>> a = a + 1.0
>>> a 
float - This answer is correct 
4.0 - This answer is correct

>>> a = 3
>>> b
NoneType - This answer is correct
error - This answer is correct
